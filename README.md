# DeepDool
##
The code of DeepFool Adversarial Attack  
The code of model is in the file "model"  
The code of DeepFool algorithm is in the file "DeepFool"   
Run the file "train" to launch the dDeepFool attack  
We provide our attack result in the directory "result":  
>In the directory "logs_train" is the tensorboard curve of model training.
The adversarial_example.png is the comparison of clean example and adversarial example. The left is clean example and the right is adversarial example.
The net_135.pth is the model of 135 epoch.
